WebAPI2AuthenticationExample
============================

This is companion code for my [blog post](http://www.azurefromthetrenches.com/?p=471) showing how to authenticate from a client application against Web API2 using OAuth and the OWIN authentication server.

The example client is an iOS application written using Xamarin but the C# code will work on any .Net platform.
